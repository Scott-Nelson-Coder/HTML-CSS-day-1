    <p>Golden Retrievers originally came into prominence because of the desire for a medium-sized dog that would do well in wild-fowling, both upland game <br>
         and waterfowl. Today, the breed's versatility, intelligence, and agreeable personality suit it for many purposes, and it has become one of the successful,<br>
        recognizable, and popular breeds in all areas of competition.

        <p>Bred to hunt alongside other dogs, the Beagle is amiable and seldom squabbles with other dogs or pets. It makes both canine and human friends easily. The <br>
             breed is outgoing, playful, cheerful, adventurous, and gentle, an entertaining companion for people of any age. Because of its independence and <br>
              distractibility, it can be a difficult dog to train. Despite being fairly active outside, Beagles can be calm house dogs. However, the breed has a <br>
               tendency to become destructive if left alone too long. Beagles are known to bark, especially when untrained or lonely. They are fairly good watchdogs <br>
                but poor protection dogs.
             <ul>
                <li>Personality: Merry, friendly, and curious</li>
                <li>Good with Children: Yes</li>
                <li>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years</li>
                <li>Barking Level: Likes To Be Vocal</li>
             </ul>
